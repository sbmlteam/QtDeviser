	This is the repository for the Deviser Edit Tool that provides a Graphical User Interface 
    to facilitate creating the xml descriptions used by Deviser.


## Background ##


Computation modeling has become a crucial aspect of biological research, and [SBML](http://sbml.org) (the Systems Biology Markup Language) has become the de facto standard open format for exchanging models between software tools in systems biology.

[LibSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams. Support for SBML Level 3 packages can be added by integrating 
the package specific code and building with the package enabled.

 SBML Level 3 is being developed as a core with additional optional packages. Deviser facilitates the development of these packages by providing a means of creating a basic specification, UML diagrams and code for integration with libSBML.


Deviser is written in Python and is compatible with Python version 2.6 onwards.



## Using Deviser ##

### Deviser Edit GUI ###

The [Deviser Edit](https://github.com/sbmlteam/QtDeviser)  tool allows you to quickly define an SBML L3 package. It then provides the  following functionality

1.	Create and view a UML diagram.
2.	Generate the necessary libSBML code for the package.
3.	Generate TeX files and generate a pdf of a basic specification document for the package.
4.	Integrate and test the package with libSBML.

The Deviser Edit tool creates an XML description of the package that is used by the deviser code to generate the requested files. This XML description is exemplified in the [samples](deviser/samples) directory.

### Command Line Interface ###

There is command line version of the function that can be used to invoke the deviser functionality on the XML file. This is the deviser.py file found in the generator directory.

    deviser.py [--generate][--latex] input-file.xml    

This program will use a Deviser xml file, and generate either a C++ 
libSBML extension for it, or generate a LaTeX scaffold for its 
specification. 

Full documentation is available in the [docs](deviser\docs) directory.


## Installation ##

The deviser release includes bundles/installer for each of the main operating systems.  

### Prerequisites

1. A C++ compiler must be installed if you wish to compile the libSBML code generated.
2. A pdflatex compiler must be installed if you wish to generate a pdf from the TeX sources generated.

**NOTE**: These may already be available on your OS.

### Microsoft Windows OS

A windows installation executable which installs the Deviser Edit tool (QtDeviser.exe), all the necessary Deviser files. Additionally it includes a python interpreter and the sbmlpkgspec files for generating SBML L3 Package specifications.


### Linux OS

A self-contained, binary installer is available that contains Deviser, DeviserEdit and the sbmlpkgspec modules. After installation DeviserEdit can be run from either a desktop icon or by calling the DeviserEdit.sh script in the installation directory. Deviser samples can be found in the deviser/samples subdirectory.

### Mac OS X

An dmg file is available containing the DeviserEdit Application that embeds the necessary Deviser and sbmlpkgspec files in addition to *docs* and *samples* directories. 

### Source archives

The source archives contain the Deviser code that can be used via the command line.


## Other resources ##

Not all of the following are necessary as what is necessary depends on which operating system is being used and which Deviser functionality is required. These links are given as a quick reference.
